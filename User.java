// author (User)
// timestamp (Date or String)
// Implement a constructor to initialize the attributes when a Post object is created.

// Create a method in the Post class to display information about the post, including the author and timestamp.

// In the main method, create instances of the User and Post classes, perform operations like adding/removing friends, and create posts with comments.
