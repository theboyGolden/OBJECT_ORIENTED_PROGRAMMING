// Create an interface called Animal with the following methods:

// void makeSound() - to print the sound the animal makes.
// void move() - to simulate the animal's movement.
// Implement two classes, Lion and Fish, that implement the Animal interface:

// Lion and Fish should have attributes specific to their type (e.g., mane for a lion, fin for a fish).
// Implement the makeSound and move methods in each class.
// Create an abstract class called ZooAnimal with the following attributes:

// name (String)
// age (int)
// Extend the Lion and Fish classes from the ZooAnimal class:

// Add constructors to initialize the attributes in the Lion and Fish classes.
// Implement any additional methods you find necessary in the ZooAnimal class.
// Create a class called Zoo with a main method where you:

// Create instances of Lion and Fish.
// Call their makeSound and move methods.
// Display information about their name, age, and type.



public class Zoo {
    
}
